While keen on euro adoption, one month before Croatia\\'s EU entry, governor Vujčić stated \"...we have no date (to join the single currency) in mind at the moment\".', 'On 7 December, Croatia and the European Commission signed a Partnership Agreement for the organisation of information and communication campaigns concerning the changeover from the kuna to the euro in Croatia.In November 2021, the Croatian right-wing and eurosceptic party Hrvatski Suverenisti was unable to obtain the required number of signatures to force a referendum to block the planned adoption of the euro.On 10 December 2021, Finance Minister Marić announced that the bill on introducing the euro currency in Croatia was being drafted and could be outlined in mid-January, with its final adoption expected in April 2022.', \"Croatia adopted the euro as its currency on 1 January 2023, becoming the 20th member state of the eurozone. A fixed conversion rate was set at 1 € = 7.5345 kn.Croatia's previous currency, the kuna, used the euro (and prior to that one of the euro's major predecessors, the German mark or Deutsche Mark) as its main reference since its creation in 1994, and a long-held policy of the Croatian National Bank was to keep the kuna's exchange rate with the euro within a relatively stable range.Croatia's European Union (EU) membership obliged it to introduce the euro once it had fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.\", 'Parliament supported the report of Siegfried Mureșan that Croatia has fulfilled all the criteria for adopting euro on 1 January 2023.On 12 July 2022, the Council of EU adopted the final three legal acts that were required for Croatia to adopt the euro as legal tender. A fixed exchange rate was set at 1 € = 7.53450 kn.\\nOn 18 July 2022, the Croatian Mint began producing euro coins with Croatian national motifs.From 5 September 2022 until 31 December 2023, display of all prices in dual currency is mandatory to prevent unjustified price increases.

Prime Minister Andrej Plenković stated in November 2020 that Croatia intended to adopt the euro on 1 January 2023, and in December 2020 the Croatian government adopted an action plan for euro adoption.Many small businesses in Croatia had debts denominated in euros before EU accession. Croatians already used the euro for most savings and many informal transactions. Real estate, motor vehicle and accommodation prices were mostly quoted in euros.', \"The official decision for euro adoption is made by the EU's ECOFIN council and could not occur prior to 10 July 2022, two years after Croatia joined the ERM II.On 1 June 2022, the Commission assessed in its 2022 convergence report that Croatia fulfilled all the criteria for joining the euro area and proposed to the Council that Croatia adopt the euro on 1 January 2023.On 16 June 2022, the euro area member states recommended that Croatia become the 20th member.

The European Central Bank (ECB) was expecting Croatia to be approved for ERM II membership in 2016 at the earliest, with euro adoption in 2019.In April 2015, President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović stated in a Bloomberg interview that she was \"confident that Croatia would introduce the euro by 2020\", although the then-Prime Minister Zoran Milanović subsequently refused to commit to such timeline for the euro adoption.In November 2017, Prime Minister Andrej Plenković said that Croatia aimed to join ERM II by 2020 and to introduce the euro initially by 2025.', \"== Background ==\\nCroatia's EU membership obliged it to join the eurozone once it fulfilled the euro convergence criteria.

He restated his confidence Croatia would be ready to enter the euro area from the start of 2023. In September 2021, following the meeting of the Eurogroup in Slovenia, Croatia signed an official agreement (a Memorandum of Understanding) with the European Commission and eurozone member states on practical steps for the actual minting of Croatian euro coins.\", \"In 2023, everyone would be able to exchange kunas for euros free of charge in banks, in the Croatian Post offices, and in financial services and payment systems branches.On 13 May 2022, the Croatian Parliament voted in favour of the proposal to introduce the euro as legal tender.In May 2022, the European Commission completed an assessment of Croatia's progress.\", 'The letter marked the first formal step towards the adoption of the euro.

However, the last of the five economic convergence criteria which need first to be complied with in order to qualify for euro adoption, is the exchange rate stability criterion, which requires having been an ERM-member for a minimum of two years without the presence of \"severe tensions\" for the currency exchange rate.', 'The government agreed that if it was re-elected in 2017 then it would agree a roadmap for adoption by 2020, however the election was lost to Andrej Babiš who had been against euro adoption in the near-term.
