The answer requires revisions for the following reasons:

C. Citing: The citations still need to be corrected to comply with the Vancouver citation style. Each citation should correspond to a unique reference. Since all the citations refer to the same Wikipedia page, they should be consolidated into a single reference listed at the end of the document. Each point should be followed by the citation number once, rather than repeating the same citation for each point.

Reporter, please revise the answer by consolidating the citations into a single reference and ensure that the citation number corresponds to it. Use the citation number once at the end of the report, rather than repeating it for each point.
