The information provided does not directly answer the question regarding the number of Germans living in the colonial holding in Aruba's continent that was governed by Prazeres's country. While there is a mention of the Aruba Phosphate Company and its workforce, it does not specify the nationality of these workers, nor does it mention German inhabitants specifically[1][2]. Additionally, the indexed information about Germans shows a broad overview of their global distribution but does not include specific numbers for Aruba or any connection to Prazeres's country, which is Madeira, a region of Portugal[3][14].

Therefore, based on the available data, I cannot provide a precise number or even confirm the presence of Germans in the colonial holding in Aruba's continent governed by Prazeres's country (Madeira, Portugal). Further research beyond the indexed content would be necessary to determine such specifics.
